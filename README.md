## 🔍 Overview

ColPali offers a groundbreaking method for document retrieval using vision language models. This project aims to demonstrate how visual-based embedding can simplify and enhance RAG systems, making them more versatile and easier to implement for a wide range of document types.

### Key Features of ColPali:

- Direct embedding of document screenshots
- No need for OCR or complex preprocessing
- Handles multi-modal content (text, images, charts, tables)
- Streamlined retrieval and ranking process
- Built on ColPali 2's efficient embedding technique
