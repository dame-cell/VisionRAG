# VisionRAG

VisionRAG is an innovative implementation of MULTI-MODALITY-RAG, leveraging the novel approach introduced in [ColPali: Efficient Document Retrieval with Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01449).

## üîç Overview!

ColPali offers a groundbreaking method for document retrieval using vision language models. This project aims to demonstrate how visual-based embedding can simplify and enhance RAG systems, making them more versatile and easier to implement for a wide range of document types.

### Key Features of ColPali:

- Direct embedding of document screenshots
- No need for OCR or complex preprocessing
- Handles multi-modal content (text, images, charts, tables)
- Streamlined retrieval and ranking process
- Built on ColPali 2's efficient embedding technique

### How fast is the indexing? 
We tested the speed of the indexing on affordable GPUs , we pass the embeddings into GPUs 
| GPU          | Batch Size | Speed (s/iteration) |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|
| NVIDIA A10g  | 4           | 2.67                |
| NVIDIA l4    | 4           | 3.6s                |
| NVIDIA t4    | 4           | 4.55                |
